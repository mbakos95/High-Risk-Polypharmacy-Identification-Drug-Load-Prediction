# 💊 High-Risk Polypharmacy Identification & Drug Load Prediction

This project focuses on identifying patients at risk of **polypharmacy** (≥5 prescribed drugs) and predicting **drug load** and **ICU length of stay** using the MIMIC-IV clinical dataset.  
It was developed as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning.

---

## 🔍 Research & Technical Questions

- Can machine learning models accurately identify patients at risk of polypharmacy?  
- Which clinical and demographic features are most predictive of **drug load**?  
- Can ICU length of stay be predicted from patient-level features to support hospital resource allocation?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Models**: Random Forest Classifier & Regressor, Pipelines with preprocessing  
- **Data Source**: MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) – de-identified patient EHRs  
- **Platform**: Google Colab

## 🔒 Data Privacy

The project uses **MIMIC-IV**, which contains **de-identified** healthcare data.  
Due to data use agreements, **raw data cannot be shared** in this repository.  
Notebooks and code are included so results can be reproduced with authorized access to MIMIC-IV.
